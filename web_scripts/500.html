<p> It appears that something has gone wrong.  (Oh no!) </p>

<p> It could be a problem with our database.  Because we have such an
awesomely large dataset, our database does decide to roll over and die
on occasion. </p>

<p> It could be a problem with our server.  Sometimes stray cosmic
raws will distrupt the caerful configuration of our
host, <a href="scripts.mit.edu">scripts.mit.edu</a>.</p>

<p> Hey, it could even be a coding error.  Those happen sometimes.</p>

<p> But rest assured, it's not a problem with you.  You seem nice.  If
you want to make us happy, you could email us
at <a href="mailto:anygit@mit.edu">anygit@mit.edu</a> and let us know
what just happened.  You should include your URL in your email.</p>

<p> Thanks, and happy git querying! </p>
